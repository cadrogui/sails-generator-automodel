# Sails Mysql AutoGen
#### Generate models automatically for Sails Js or Waterline for Mysql connections

##### Version 2.0.0

One bad thing when you work with sails js is do all the models by hand... until now, this generator helps to do this task in a very simple way.


The usage of this generator is a bite simple.

```sh
#npm i sails-mysql-autogen -g
```

### Usage

Go to the directory that will models be loaded, and run

```sh
#sails-mysql-autogen
```

Sails Mysql AutoGen will prompt connection data for usage.... and thats all, it will generate all files for represent you database, in the current directory.

### Data Types
Automodel support all data types present in waterline:
* string
* text
* integer
* float
* date
* time
* datetime
* boolean
* binary
* array
* json

#### Associations
At this version AutoModel can detect all foreign keys only as model attribute, if in your associations you need the virtual attribute collections you must create by your self, but half way is taken by AutoModel, in the next releases i will try to give the power to AutoModel to handle complete associations.

#### AutoModel in action

#### Models generated by AutoModel
##### Model Pets

```
module.exports = {
    "identity": "Pets",
    "connection": "sails_test",
    "autoCreatedAt": false,
    "autoUpdatedAt": false,
    "attributes": {
        "id": {
            "type": "INTEGER",
            "primaryKey": "TRUE",
            "autoIncrement": "TRUE"
        },
        "name": "STRING",
        "Owners": {
            "model": "Owners",
            "columnName": "owner_id"
        }
    }
}
```

##### Model Owners

```
module.exports = {
    "identity": "Owners",
    "connection": "sails_test",
    "autoCreatedAt": false,
    "autoUpdatedAt": false,
    "attributes": {
        "id": {
            "type": "INTEGER",
            "primaryKey": "TRUE",
            "autoIncrement": "TRUE"
        },
        "name": "STRING",
        "lastname": "STRING",
        "email": "STRING"
    }
}
```

As you can see automodel helps a lot with the tedious task of creating the models.

I hope AutoModel helps to make all of your models as an easy task, as well for me.
